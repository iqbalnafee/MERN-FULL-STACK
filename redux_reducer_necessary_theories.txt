1. Redux is a state manager and it is use for larger applications

2. It is not the only option. Instead of it, we can use context api built in react.

3. Register, login are component level state and post,profile are app level state and we can access app level state from any component level state.

4. And thats where redux copmes in. It gives us app level state.

5. So we can think redux as a cloud which floats over our application that we can submit actions through events and we can then get data to fall down into any component

6. Lets consider a exmaple of profile:

    6.a) Profile data we get from the server and that's gonna be put into what's called a store a redux store. So  we can think the redux store as a cloud

    6.b) And from any component we can call  an action that will do something

    6.c) Lets we want to update our profile

    6.d) So we will make a request to the server, make the update on the server on the database

    6.e) We got a response and then what we want to do is we want to update our user interface

    6.f) So anything we need to update, any component. That's happen what is through we called reducer which is just a function that takes in what we called in an action

    6.g) We can dispatch an action to the reducer and then reducer decides how to handle the state and how to pass it down to the components in the UI

    6.h) And it will update any components that use that piece of the state

    6.i) This prevents us from having to pass things around from components to components without using  a state manager
