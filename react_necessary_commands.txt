1. npx create-react-app clientside // will create a react app folder name client not globally

2. cd clientside

3a). npm start // to run react dev server

3b). cd ..

4. // If we use step's no.3 command then we need to terminal two run both client and server. To avoid this we will use the following commands 

5. "client": "npm start --prefix clientside" in server's folder package.json file in scripts. // this will run react app inside clientside folder


6. "dev":"concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\" " //same place as step 5 to run both the client and server

7. npm run dev // in main folder which is DEVCONNECTOR . To run both backend and frontend

8. cd clientside

9. npm i axios react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment // to install some react modules

10. cd ..

11. // we dont want to write every time axios.get(http://localhost:5000/api/profile). instead we want to write (api/profile). For this we need to create a proxy in clientside package.json file
